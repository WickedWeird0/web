      <h4>Front End Web Development Coding Languages</h4></li>
      <p>A front-end web developer works on the user side of applications. This means that you’ll be coding webpages, games, and any software or application that people can see. For example, a front-end web developer most likely coded the webpage that you’re reading right now.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The list of front end coding languages includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <p>It’s important to understand the scope of HTML. Without the coding language, web pages wouldn’t work. In short, HTML code formats the text, images, and other media that make up a webpage. The language communicates with the computer using a series of attributes and elements. HTML has evolved greatly over time. The language now enables web pages to host videos, sound, and more. It’s important to note that HTML couldn’t make a very functional webpage by itself.<br><br>The coding language relies heavily on CSS and JavaScript. To make it as simple as possible, think of HTML as the structure of a website while CSS is the style and JavaScript is the functionality. HTML is a highly important coding language that has continued to help shape the internet and web browsing as we know it. </p>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets goes hand in hand with HTML. If HTML is the bread and butter of a website, then CSS is the package that they come in. CSS takes the text-based website that you’ve made and applies things like color, images, videos, and other media to it. CSS makes websites look more appealing to viewers.</p>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <p>JavaScript is the knife that actually spreads the butter onto the bread. JavaScript is all about functionality. JavaScript is one of the most popular coding languages in the coding universe right now. JavaScript is also a highly diverse language that can be used to code anything from video games to websites. It can also be used for both mobile and desktop apps. JavaScript was a required skill for over 470,000 jobs in tech last year. Potential jobs could include web development, front end development, or JavaScript engineering. </p>
