    <h2>Computer programming</h2>
    <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

      <li><h4>Front End Web Development Coding Languages</h4></li>
      <p>A front-end web developer works on the user side of applications. This means that you’ll be coding webpages, games, and any software or application that people can see. For example, a front-end web developer most likely coded the webpage that you’re reading right now.</p>
      <p>The list of front end coding languages includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <p>It’s important to understand the scope of HTML. Without the coding language, web pages wouldn’t work. In short, HTML code formats the text, images, and other media that make up a webpage. The language communicates with the computer using a series of attributes and elements. HTML has evolved greatly over time. The language now enables web pages to host videos, sound, and more. It’s important to note that HTML couldn’t make a very functional webpage by itself.<br><br>The coding language relies heavily on CSS and JavaScript. To make it as simple as possible, think of HTML as the structure of a website while CSS is the style and JavaScript is the functionality. HTML is a highly important coding language that has continued to help shape the internet and web browsing as we know it. </p>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets goes hand in hand with HTML. If HTML is the bread and butter of a website, then CSS is the package that they come in. CSS takes the text-based website that you’ve made and applies things like color, images, videos, and other media to it. CSS makes websites look more appealing to viewers.</p>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <p>JavaScript is the knife that actually spreads the butter onto the bread. JavaScript is all about functionality. JavaScript is one of the most popular coding languages in the coding universe right now. JavaScript is also a highly diverse language that can be used to code anything from video games to websites. It can also be used for both mobile and desktop apps. JavaScript was a required skill for over 470,000 jobs in tech last year. Potential jobs could include web development, front end development, or JavaScript engineering. </p>
      </ul>
      <li>Back End Web Development Coding Languages</li>
      <p>As one might imagine, back end developers manage the back end of applications or all of the things that take place behind the scenes. This is known as server-side programming. In order for this webpage to show up on your computer, as well as communicate with the servers that house all of Career Karma’s data, a back end web developer had to construct and code that process.</p>
      <p>The list of back end coding languages includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <p>Python is a general-use programming language meaning that it can be used for almost anything. Python is one of the most popular programming languages among big tech giants and startups. The language is perfect for beginners because it rejects complexity and is very simple to learn. Coders who know Python would be eligible for jobs in back end development, server coding, and more. Popular sites such as Google, Pinterest, Instagram, and Dropbox were all built using Python. </p>
        <li>Java</li>
        <p>Not to be confused with JavaScript, Java is a general-purpose coding language that has remained popular for over 20 years. The main benefit of writing in Java is its versatility. Its philosophy has always been “write once, run anywhere”. Java is cross-platform compatible and is the basis for most Android operating systems. The language is favored by industry giants, with over 90% of Fortune 500 companies using Java to build their platforms and support their back end systems. Prominent sites that use Java include Facebook, Amazon, and Yahoo.</p>
        <li>Ruby</li>
        <p>Ruby is known for having one of the most friendly and widespread coding communities. While learning this coding language, you’ll never be short of helpful mentors to lend a guiding hand during your journey. Ruby is unique because it runs on the Ruby on Rails framework. The syntax of the language is very straightforward and easy to comprehend. Companies such as Twitter, Airbnb, Shopify, and thousands of other startups have built their platforms using Ruby. Ruby is continuously growing in popularity amongst educational outlets too, as many different coding educational platforms now specialize on both Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework.</p>
