    <h3>What is a Video Game or a Computer Game</h3>
    <p>A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device  such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing  device. To generate visual feedback. This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.</p>
